## Structure
Lecture videos for a week will be released on Monday and posted here.  Please take a look at them promptly!

The Teams Team is "COMS20011: Data-Driven Computer Science 2021/22 (TB-2, A)".  You should have access already through the "Teams" panel.  If not, please get in touch with the school office!

The course is assessed 100% by exam.

The routes for feedback are:
- Lecturer led QA sessions on Tuesdays at 2pm
- TA led sessions on Thursday 1-3.  You can ask about all aspects of the course lectures, labs and exams.  We have a room for these (MVB 2.11), and some support will be available in the room, and some online, through Teams (which can also be accessed in the room).  The first lab session is on 27th Feb.

There will be "lab" exercises released in the "lab" folder.

## Mathematical background material
Important: these are not pre-requisites!  Please don't try to look at all of the material!  They're intended as supplements to the first-year maths courses to help clear up specific issues with the derivations in the course.  Feel free to raise an issue/pull-request if you have recommendations for other resources.
