## Structure
Lecture videos for a week will be released on Monday and posted here.  Please take a look at them promptly!

The Teams Team is "COMS20011: Data-Driven Computer Science 2021/22 (TB-2, A)".  You should have access already through the "Teams" panel.  If not, please get in touch with the school office!

The course is assessed 100% by exam.

TA led sessions on Thursday 1-3 are the main route for feedback on all aspects of the course: lectures, labs and coursework.  We have a room for these (MVB 2.11), and some support will be available in the room, and some online, through Teams.  The first lab session is on 27th Feb.

There are lecturer-led Q&A sessions on Tuesdays at 2pm.

There will be "lab" exercises released in the "lab" folder.  Please do them promptly and bring any questions to the TA-led sessions: the coursework is heavily based on the labs!

## Mathematical background material
Important: these are not pre-requisites!  Please don't try to look at all of the material!  They're intended as supplements to the first-year maths courses to help clear up specific issues with the derivations in the course.  Feel free to raise an issue/pull-request if you have recommendations for other resources.
